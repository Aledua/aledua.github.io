## Transcription samples
The following are basic examples of audio transcription in English and Spanish, complete with corresponding speaker identification labels, as well as tags for interruptions, breathing, side speech, pauses, etc. The labels provided are for illustrative purposes only, and the timestamps can be adjusted according to the client's preferences. In these particular examples, a fast-food restaurant was randomly selected, and names, brands, and any items that may appear on the menu are highlighted in uppercase for the purpose of entity recognition in training a language model.
