The scene is set indoors in a room with white walls. The lighting is bright, coming from an unseen source on the right side of the screen, which illuminates the right side of the woman’s body more prominently.

From the lower center to the upper center of the screen, there is a woman facing the camera, visible from the waist up with her arms at her sides. She has light skin, dark brown eyes, and long, straight, dark brown hair. Her hair is parted slightly off-center on her left. She has dark eyebrows, full lips, and a slender frame. She is wearing a white button-up shirt with long sleeves and round, silver-colored buttons. The top three buttons are left undone. The shirt has two pockets, one on each side of her chest. She is also wearing a thin choker necklace with a small, rounded silver-colored charm at her throat. Her facial expression features a direct gaze into the camera, with her lips pressed together in a subtle smile. 

In the background, there is a white wall with horizontal paneling extending from the top to the bottom of the screen. On the third line of the paneling, from top to bottom, two small black dots are visible, slightly apart: one in the top left corner and the other in the upper center of the screen. There are two dark brown, vertical, rectangular posts on the wall. One is at a slight diagonal along the left edge of the frame, leaving a small white space with shadows in the bottom left corner of the screen. The other is behind the woman, spanning from the top center to the center of the screen.

Located between the left center and the center of the screen, a black rectangular monitor is on the wall. Below it, near the bottom left corner of the screen and extending toward the bottom center, is a light beige rectangular surface, with the right edge of the table surface obscured by the woman. On the far left side of the table surface is a rectangular object positioned vertically. The side of the object that is facing the camera is black, and the top and right sides are dark brown. To the right of this object, there is a stack of three thin rectangular objects. The one on the bottom has white edges. The one in the middle has white edges and a yellow cover on top. The one on top is gray and smaller than the others. On the right side of the table surface, there is a dark gray circular object with a silver-colored reflective edge, placed on top of a gray rectangular object positioned horizontally. The front of the table surface is black on the left side and has a shelf on the right side.

On the right side of the screen is a dark brown hanging egg chair facing the left. A thick silver-colored chain is visible from the top right edge to the right center of the screen, attached to the top of the chair. The egg chair, visible from the right center to the bottom right corner of the screen, has a series of horizontal and vertical bars forming a curved backrest. It also features large openings on its sides and a similarly colored cushion for the backrest and seat. A cream-colored, furry-textured, semi-square object with a fold at its top right corner is resting on the chair, positioned just to the right of the woman's left elbow.

The camera makes a dolly-in movement, causing the dark brown post on the left side of the screen to move out of the frame gradually from top to bottom. 

<00:01.560>
The woman at the center of the screen blinks. 

<00:02.240>
The woman tilts her head upward.

The woman's lips extend further into a smile while she continues to look toward the camera.

The clip ends abruptly.
