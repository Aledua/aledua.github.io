This scene was captured in a softly lit setting with even lighting and an out-of-focus green and white surface visible in the background. In the foreground, a light source illuminates the subject from the left side off-screen.

On the left side of the screen, a cat with brown fur and reddish-orange tones, along with black streaks across its body head, is looking directly at the camera. The cat's eyes irises are light green in the center with yellow around the edges, and the eye closest to the right edge of the screen is darker due to the lighting. The pupils are black, slightly elongated vertically, with white highlights reflecting the scene's lighting on the cat’s right eye. The cat's head features black-brown markings on the top, around its eyes, above its nose, and alongside its snout. Surrounding the snout, there are white fur details. The cat's eyes, snout, and nose are outlined in black. Its whiskers are white. The cat's nose is light brown.

The cat's right side is slightly more illuminated than its left side. Additionally, the cat's head is slightly tilted toward the left side of the screen. Its left ears point toward the top edge of the screen while its right ear points toward the upper left corner and both have gray shadows in the center.

The background of the scene is out-of-focus. In the bottom left corner of the screen, there is an irregular gray section with a curved line at the top.

The right side of this rectangle is slightly darker than the left, and its top right is partially covered by the cat's right ear. 

At the bottom of the screen, there is a white section that spans the lower center and the bottom right corner of the screen. This section has a curved line at the top. In the lower center and center of the screen, there is an L-shaped green section extending across the upper center and part of the top left areas of the screen.

On the right side of the screen, there is a light gray rectangular section positioned vertically. To the right of this section, there is a narrow white rectangle positioned vertically, which has a horizontal line in the center extending towards the center of the right of the screen. Near the right edge, there is a black section with gray details located in the center of the right and bottom right areas of the screen. On the top right corner of the screen, there is a small, vertical light gray section.
