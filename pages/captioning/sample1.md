This scene was shot indoors. The lighting in the scene is bright and uniform throughout the setting.

In the center of the screen, slightly to the right, is an adult man with short black hair, tan brown skin, and a black mustache. He is wearing a light beige dress shirt with a small black oval object clipped at chest level. The shirt is buttoned all the way up, just below the collar. The man is slightly facing and looking to the left side of the screen while he is visible from the chest up. The man's head casts a shadow toward the right side on the backrest and wall behind.

Behind the man is the top of a backrest. The backrest resembles woven cane featuring a crisscross hexagonal pattern within a dark brown frame. The backrest near the right side of the man's head has a bright reflection making it look slightly silver-colored. 

In the bottom left corner of the frame, a small vertical brown rectangle is visible.

The background features a brown wall with ten vertical panels. The panels have a wood texture with lighter line details, and they are divided by vertical black stripes spaced evenly across the back wall.

<02:03.480> - <02:09.399>

Camera Motions: Pan to the right + Multiple
Shot Size: Long Shot

The scene is set outdoors. The illumination in the scene is bright and even. The atmosphere is quiet with the pile of bricks serving as the main point of focus.

Small rectangular, light gray-beige objects are visible along the center of the screen. These objects are stacked haphazardly, forming an irregular wall with a rough and uneven surface. Some rectangular objects protrude more than others. In the right center of the screen, fewer light gray objects are present, forming a U-shaped opening. The wall extends from the left edge of the frame, narrowing towards the right center edge of the frame. Slightly to the left of the center of the screen, a gray and white fabric-like object covers a small portion of the top and center of the wall, to the left of the U-shaped opening.

In the background, at the top left corner of the screen, there are dark green leaves. In the top area of the screen from left to right, thick gray-brown tree trunks and green foliage are visible. The area behind the trees is shrouded in darkness, obscuring any visible objects. In the top right corner of the screen, there are dark green leaves. Right behind is a barely visible light brown structure. The structure has two small black squares near the top center of the screen. The squares are aligned vertically with the top one more to the left.

At the bottom of the frame, green grass covers the ground in front of the wall. On the bottom left corner of the screen, there are gray rocks and debris. From just below the center to the right center of the screen, the ground is light brown and scattered with gray debris.

<02:03.480> - <02:09.399>
The camera pans to the right, gradually revealing more of the right side of the scene. Simultaneously, the camera makes slight vertical movements while continuously panning to the right.

<02:06.057>
The rocks and debris in the lower-left corner of the frame are no longer visible.

<02:07.157>
The bottom of the screen is mostly covered by green grass. To the right of the U-shaped opening, part of the wall is collapsed, forming an irregular pile of gray rectangular objects. Behind the collapsed wall more gray-brown tree trunks and green foliage are visible. In the top right corner of the screen, behind the trunks, there is a dark gray vertical surface. The ground in front of the wall is littered with gray debris.

<02:08.762>
The U-shaped opening is now located in the left-center of the screen. In the upper right section of the screen, the wall remains intact. In the right center of the screen, there is a patch of green grass. In front of and to the right of the collapsed wall, there is a thick, grayish-brown tree trunk. In the top right corner of the frame, dark green leaves are visible.

Camera Motion: Zoom Out
Camera Height: N/A
Camera Angle: Downward Angle
Shot Size: Medium Full Shot

The scene takes place outdoors. The lighting is bright and warm. Overall, the location is quiet.

A light gray-beige rectangular structure occupies most of the screen. The structure is positioned diagonally, facing the left side of the screen, and features a stepped design.

The first step at the top of the structure is partially covered with a broken stone slab. The stone slab is positioned just below the top center of the screen. Another piece of broken stone slab is at the bottom left corner of the screen. A large, irregular hole is located at the top center of the structure, revealing a dark, empty cavity beneath. The edges of this hole are jagged, with chunks of stone and debris scattered around it.

Two more steps are visible on the right side of the screen. The second step is taller and has rectangular carvings on the side and protruding top edges. Below, a third step is visible.  On the right side of the screen, the structure has soft shadows giving it a warm tone. The structure gets cut off by the bottom edges of the frame.

Behind the structure, towards the right-center of the screen, there is dark green grass.

In the top right part of the screen, a light gray structure with three distinct levels is visible. The bottom level is taller, and the structure shows signs of wear, with weathered edges and a slightly faded surface. In the top left corner of the screen, a partially visible gray rectangular structure is topped with long, dark green grass. Green grass is visible near the base of the structure, on the left-center of the screen.

There is some greenery in the background, in the top center of the screen.

<02:22.120> - <02:24.480>     
The camera does a zoom-out, gradually revealing less of the scene.

<02:23.079>
On the bottom left of the screen, centered on the second step of the structure, is a carved inscription with an oblong shape.

<02:24.379>
A fourth step is visible at the bottom right of the screen. The second step of the structure is now fully visible, with two black vertical lines on each side. Each edge of the second step features two vertical rectangular decorative elements carved into the stone, with simple details. These decorative elements frame the central inscription.

In the upper left corner, above the gray structure, there is more green foliage with small light gray tips.

In the top right corner, the top of the light gray structure is more visible. It has a rectangular base that narrows up to a point. The very top is cut off on the top right edge of the frame. Overgrown dark green grass is visible behind it.

The video ends abruptly.
