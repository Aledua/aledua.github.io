This scene was shot indoors. The lighting in the scene is bright and uniform throughout the setting.

In the center of the screen, slightly to the right, is an adult man with short black hair, tan brown skin, and a black mustache. He is wearing a light beige dress shirt with a small black oval object clipped at chest level. The shirt is buttoned all the way up, just below the collar. The man is slightly facing and looking to the left side of the screen while he is visible from the chest up. The man's head casts a shadow toward the right side on the backrest and wall behind.

Behind the man is the top of a backrest. The backrest resembles woven cane featuring a crisscross hexagonal pattern within a dark brown frame. The backrest near the right side of the man's head has a bright reflection making it look slightly silver-colored. 

In the bottom left corner of the frame, a small vertical brown rectangle is visible.

The scene is set outdoors. The illumination in the scene is bright and even. The atmosphere is quiet with the pile of bricks serving as the main point of focus.

Small rectangular, light gray-beige objects are visible along the center of the screen. These objects are stacked haphazardly, forming an irregular wall with a rough and uneven surface. Some rectangular objects protrude more than others. In the right center of the screen, fewer light gray objects are present, forming a U-shaped opening. The wall extends from the left edge of the frame, narrowing towards the right center edge of the frame. Slightly to the left of the center of the screen, a gray and white fabric-like object covers a small portion of the top and center of the wall, to the left of the U-shaped opening.

In the background, at the top left corner of the screen, there are dark green leaves. In the top area of the screen from left to right, thick gray-brown tree trunks and green foliage are visible. The area behind the trees is shrouded in darkness, obscuring any visible objects. In the top right corner of the screen, there are dark green leaves. Right behind is a barely visible light brown structure. The structure has two small black squares near the top center of the screen. The squares are aligned vertically with the top one more to the left.

At the bottom of the frame, green grass covers the ground in front of the wall. On the bottom left corner of the screen, there are gray rocks and debris. From just below the center to the right center of the screen, the ground is light brown and scattered with gray debris.

<02:03.480> - <02:09.399>

<02:06.057>
The rocks and debris in the lower-left corner of the frame are no longer visible.

<02:07.157>
The bottom of the screen is mostly covered by green grass. To the right of the U-shaped opening, part of the wall is collapsed, forming an irregular pile of gray rectangular objects. Behind the collapsed wall more gray-brown tree trunks and green foliage are visible. In the top right corner of the screen, behind the trunks, there is a dark gray vertical surface. The ground in front of the wall is littered with gray debris.

<02:08.762>
The U-shaped opening is now located in the left-center of the screen. In the upper right section of the screen, the wall remains intact. In the right center of the screen, there is a patch of green grass. In front of and to the right of the collapsed wall, there is a thick, grayish-brown tree trunk. In the top right corner of the frame, dark green leaves are visible.

The scene takes place outdoors. The lighting is bright and warm. Overall, the location is quiet.

A light gray-beige rectangular structure occupies most of the screen. The structure is positioned diagonally, facing the left side of the screen, and features a stepped design.

The first step at the top of the structure is partially covered with a broken stone slab. The stone slab is positioned just below the top center of the screen. Another piece of broken stone slab is at the bottom left corner of the screen. A large, irregular hole is located at the top center of the structure, revealing a dark, empty cavity beneath. The edges of this hole are jagged, with chunks of stone and debris scattered around it.

Two more steps are visible on the right side of the screen. The second step is taller and has rectangular carvings on the side and protruding top edges. Below, a third step is visible.  On the right side of the screen, the structure has soft shadows giving it a warm tone. The structure gets cut off by the bottom edges of the frame.

Behind the structure, towards the right-center of the screen, there is dark green grass.

In the top right part of the screen, a light gray structure with three distinct levels is visible. The bottom level is taller, and the structure shows signs of wear, with weathered edges and a slightly faded surface. In the top left corner of the screen, a partially visible gray rectangular structure is topped with long, dark green grass. Green grass is visible near the base of the structure, on the left-center of the screen.

There is some greenery in the background, in the top center of the screen.

<02:23.079>
On the bottom left of the screen, centered on the second step of the structure, is a carved inscription with an oblong shape.

<02:24.379>
A fourth step is visible at the bottom right of the screen. The second step of the structure is now fully visible, with two black vertical lines on each side. Each edge of the second step features two vertical rectangular decorative elements carved into the stone, with simple details. These decorative elements frame the central inscription.

In the upper left corner, above the gray structure, there is more green foliage with small light gray tips.

In the top right corner, the top of the light gray structure is more visible. It has a rectangular base that narrows up to a point. The very top is cut off on the top right edge of the frame. Overgrown dark green grass is visible behind it.

The scene is set indoors in a room with white walls. The lighting is bright, coming from an unseen source on the right side of the screen, which illuminates the right side of the womanâ€™s body more prominently.

From the lower center to the upper center of the screen, there is a woman facing the camera, visible from the waist up with her arms at her sides. She has light skin, dark brown eyes, and long, straight, dark brown hair. Her hair is parted slightly off-center on her left. She has dark eyebrows, full lips, and a slender frame. She is wearing a white button-up shirt with long sleeves and round, silver-colored buttons. The top three buttons are left undone. The shirt has two pockets, one on each side of her chest. She is also wearing a thin choker necklace with a small, rounded silver-colored charm at her throat. Her facial expression features a direct gaze into the camera, with her lips pressed together in a subtle smile. 

In the background, there is a white wall with horizontal paneling extending from the top to the bottom of the screen. On the third line of the paneling, from top to bottom, two small black dots are visible, slightly apart: one in the top left corner and the other in the upper center of the screen. There are two dark brown, vertical, rectangular posts on the wall. One is at a slight diagonal along the left edge of the frame, leaving a small white space with shadows in the bottom left corner of the screen. The other is behind the woman, spanning from the top center to the center of the screen.

Located between the left center and the center of the screen, a black rectangular monitor is on the wall. Below it, near the bottom left corner of the screen and extending toward the bottom center, is a light beige rectangular surface, with the right edge of the table surface obscured by the woman. On the far left side of the table surface is a rectangular object positioned vertically. The side of the object that is facing the camera is black, and the top and right sides are dark brown. To the right of this object, there is a stack of three thin rectangular objects. The one on the bottom has white edges. The one in the middle has white edges and a yellow cover on top. The one on top is gray and smaller than the others. On the right side of the table surface, there is a dark gray circular object with a silver-colored reflective edge, placed on top of a gray rectangular object positioned horizontally. The front of the table surface is black on the left side and has a shelf on the right side.

On the right side of the screen is a dark brown hanging egg chair facing the left. A thick silver-colored chain is visible from the top right edge to the right center of the screen, attached to the top of the chair. The egg chair, visible from the right center to the bottom right corner of the screen, has a series of horizontal and vertical bars forming a curved backrest. It also features large openings on its sides and a similarly colored cushion for the backrest and seat. A cream-colored, furry-textured, semi-square object with a fold at its top right corner is resting on the chair, positioned just to the right of the woman's left elbow.

<00:00.000> - <00:05.759>
The camera makes a dolly-in movement, causing the dark brown post on the left side of the screen to move out of the frame gradually from top to bottom. 

<00:01.560>
